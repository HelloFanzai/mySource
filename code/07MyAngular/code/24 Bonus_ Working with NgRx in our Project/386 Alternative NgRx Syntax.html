Exploring the alternative, a bit shorter syntax might therefore be an interesting next step.</p><p>Jost created a nice post where he summarizes the new syntax + how to adjust the course project to use it:&nbsp;<a href="https://www.udemy.com/the-complete-guide-to-angular-2/learn/lecture/14466642#questions/7350498" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">https://www.udemy.com/the-complete-guide-to-angular-2/learn/lecture/14466642#questions/7350498</a></p><p><strong>You also find the transformed code attached to this lecture!</strong></p><p>Also check out the official docs to learn more about it:&nbsp;<a href="https://ngrx.io/docs" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">https://ngrx.io/docs</a></p><p><strong>Again, just because it's important</strong>:&nbsp;This syntax is <strong>not</strong> better, faster or more secure than the one taught in the course. The entire switch of the official docs is pretty drastic (and hard to understand to be very honest) since the syntax taught in this course was the syntax used for close to two years now. Many teams will certainly still be on that syntax and that alone is a strong reason to learn it. </p></p>
